# 2-3-Tree
A 2-3 Tree data structure I created during Data Structures II (a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Computer Science course taught at Algoma University).

Some updates have been made to the code in order to improve its quality.

I chose to publish and update this project as a way to practice both using GitHub and writing "clean code".

## What is a 2-3 Tree?
A **2-3 Tree** is a *full search tree*. This means that the tree can be quickly traversed to find any data item within it and each leaf node of the tree is located at the lowest level.

Every node within a 2-3 Tree can either be a **2-Node** or a **3-Node**. Hence the name 2-3 Tree.
- A **2-Node** contains **1 item** and has **2 children**.
- A **3-Node** contains **2 items** and has **3 children**.

>*Leaf nodes are an exception as they don't have any children.*
